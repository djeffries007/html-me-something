					<p>Goku's brother, Raditz, arrives and reveals to Goku he is a Saiyan.
                        Together, they can finish the mission to conquer the earth. Goku refuses, so Raditz kidnaps Gohan. After lots of yelling and flexing, Piccolo, Goku, and Raditz fight. Goku sacrifaces himself so Piccolo could kill Raditz with a Special Beam Cannon. Piccolo, Bulma, Krillin, and Master Roshi learn
                        two more Saiyans, Vegeta and the inferior Nappa, will arrive on earth in one year. In the afterlife, Goku trains under King Kai and becomes more powerful than ever.</p>

                        and flexing, they all die, all of them! Piccolo sacrifices himself to save Gohan. Since Piccolo dies, his other half Kami dies as well. 
                        Goku arrives late with his power over 9000 and makes easy work of Nappa. Vegeta kills Nappa in disgust and takes on Goku. Gohan, Krillen, and Yajorobe help Goku defeat Vegeta.
                        Krillen overhears Vegeta mention another set of Dragon Balls on the planet Namek. Goku spares Vegeta life and flees to Earth.</p>

					<p>Gohan and Krillen use the Dragon Balls to revive Piccolo, which brings Dragon Balls back to earth. None of them are a match for Frieza. Vegeta loses all hope until Goku arrives, fashionably late, as always.

                        After much yelling and flexing, Goku turns Super Saiyan. On earth the Dragon Balls are used to revive the fallen fighters and teleport
                        everyone, except Frieza and Goku, from Namek to Earth. Goku defeats Frieza and the Planet Namek is destroyed.</p>
