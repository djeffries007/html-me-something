					<h2>Saiyan-Saga...</h2>
					<p>Goku's brother, Raditz, arrives and reveals to Goku he is a Saiyan.
                        Together, they can finish the mission to conquer the earth. Goku refuses, so Raditz kidnaps Gohan. After lots of yelling and flexing, Piccolo, Goku, and Raditz fight. Goku sacrifaces himself so Piccolo could kill Raditz with a Special Beam Cannon. Piccolo, Bulma, Krillin, and Master Roshi learn
                        two more Saiyans, Vegeta and the inferior Nappa, will arrive on earth in one year. In the afterlife, Goku trains under King Kai and becomes more powerful than ever.</p>

                        everyone, except Frieza and Goku, from Namek to Earth. Goku defeats Frieza and the Planet Namek is destroyed.</p>
